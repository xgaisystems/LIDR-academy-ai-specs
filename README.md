## 🤖 Multi-Copilot Support

This repository uses **symbolic links** or **naming conventions** to support multiple AI coding copilots without duplication:

- **`AGENTS.md`** → Generic agent rules (works with most copilots)
- **`CLAUDE.md`** → Optimized for Claude/Cursor
- **`codex.md`** → Optimized for GitHub Copilot/Codex
- **`GEMINI.md`** → Optimized for Google Gemini

All these files reference the same core rules in `docs/base-standards.md`, ensuring consistency across different AI tools while allowing copilot-specific customizations.

### Why This Approach?

✅ **Single Source of Truth**: Core rules maintained in one place (`base-standards.md`)  
✅ **Copilot Compatibility**: Each AI tool finds its configuration using its preferred naming convention  
✅ **Zero Configuration**: Import into a new project and it works immediately  
✅ **Easy Updates**: Update rules once, all copilots benefit  
✅ **Portable**: Copy this structure to any project  

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. (Recommended) Install and Initialize OpenSpec

OpenSpec works great with this repository and is recommended for a spec-driven workflow.

Quick Start requirements from OpenSpec official docs:

- Node.js `20.19.0` or higher

Install OpenSpec globally:

```bash
npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest
```

Then navigate to your project and initialize:

```bash
cd your-project
openspec init
```

### 2. Import Into Your Project

Copy this repository into your project first, so the `docs/` and `ai-specs/` paths already exist when you configure OpenSpec:

```bash
# Clone or copy this repository into your project (`-n`: do not overwrite existing files so you keep project's original README)
cp -rn LIDR-ai-specs/* your-project/
```

### 3. Customize `docs/` for Your Project (Mandatory)

This step is required. If you skip it, your AI assistant will use generic technical context instead of your real project context.

Update the files in `docs/` to match your stack, architecture patterns, domain language, API contracts, and data model.

For detailed guidance and ready-to-use prompt examples, see [Customization](#-customization).

### 4. Point `config.yml` to Your `docs` Folder

After `openspec init` and after copying this repository, update your project's `config.yml` to include your technical context from `docs`.

Prompt example to automate this with your copilot:

```text
Update my openspec config.yml context to reference this repository's docs and ai-specs structure.

Requirements:
- Use docs/base-standards.md as the single source of truth.
- Include docs/backend-standards.md, docs/frontend-standards.md, docs/documentation-standards.md.
- Include docs/api-spec.yml and docs/data-model.md.
- Tell the agent to adopt ai-specs/agents/backend-developer.md for backend work and ai-specs/agents/frontend-developer.md for frontend work.
- Mention ai-specs/skills as workflow guidance.
- Keep all paths relative to the project root.
```

Example (`config.yml`):

```yml
context: |
  Tech stack: TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Prisma, Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
  Architecture: Clean Architecture with Domain, Application, and Presentation layers
  We use conventional commits
  Domain: LTI (Leadership. Technology. Impact) ATS platform
  All code, comments, documentation, and technical artifacts must be in English

  Project specs (single source of truth): All artifact creation and implementation MUST follow the project's technical context in ai-specs/. Read and apply these when creating or implementing:
  - docs/base-standards.md — core principles, TDD, language standards, links to backend/frontend/docs standards
  - docs/backend-standards.md — API, database, testing, security (backend changes)
  - docs/frontend-standards.md — React, UI/UX (frontend changes)
  - docs/api-spec.yml — API contracts and endpoint definitions
  - docs/data-model.md — domain and data model
  - docs/documentation-standards.md — docs structure and maintenance
  For implementation: adopt the relevant agent from ai-specs/agents/ (e.g. backend-developer.md for backend, frontend-developer.md for frontend). Use ai-specs/skills/ for workflow guidance when applicable.

# Per-artifact rules (optional)
# Add custom rules for specific artifacts.
rules:
  # Global: apply ai-specs when creating any artifact
  _global:
    - Before creating any artifact, read and apply docs/base-standards.md
    - For backend-related artifacts, read docs/backend-standards.md and adopt guidelines from ai-specs/agents/backend-developer.md
    - For frontend-related artifacts, read docs/frontend-standards.md and adopt guidelines from ai-specs/agents/frontend-developer.md
    - Use docs/api-spec.yml and docs/data-model.md for API and data consistency in specs and tasks
```

### 5. Verify Configuration

Your AI copilot will automatically load:
- **Claude/Cursor**: `CLAUDE.md` → `docs/base-standards.md`
- **GitHub Copilot**: `codex.md` → `docs/base-standards.md`
- **Gemini**: `GEMINI.md` → `docs/base-standards.md`

All paths and rules are configured to work seamlessly without manual adjustments.

## 💡 Usage: Official OpenSpec Workflow

The recommended workflow in this repository uses official OpenSpec commands:

1. **`/enrich-us`** (optional): refine a vague user story or idea
2. **`/ff`**: create all required OpenSpec artifacts
3. **`/apply`**: implement tasks one by one
4. **`/verify`**: validate implementation against the change artifacts
5. **`/archive`**: archive the completed change
6. **`/commit`**: create focused commit(s) after verification

### Example: End-to-End Flow

Use these commands in sequence:

```bash
/enrich-us SCRUM-10
/ff SCRUM-10
/apply SCRUM-10
/verify SCRUM-10
/archive SCRUM-10
/commit
```

Artifacts are managed through OpenSpec change directories during this flow.

## 📖 Core Development Rules

## 🔧 Customization

### Adapting to Your Project

1. **Update technical context**: Find the different files in `docs` and modify core principles, coding standards, business rules and technical documentation to match your needs:
   - backend/frontend/testing/documentation standards
   - installation guide
   - data model
   - API docs
   - ...
2. **Adapt agents in `ai-specs/agents`**: Adjust agent definitions to your project's roles and workflows
3. **Extend skills in `ai-specs/skills`**: Define battle-tested prompts and workflows in reusable skills
4. **Link Resources**: Reference your project's specific documentation or tasks using MCPs
5. **Keep the symlink structure**: Remember to create relative symlinks from `.claude` and `.cursor` to the corresponding `ai-specs/agents` and `ai-specs/skills` entries to keep it consistent

### Prompt Example: Adapt Technical Context

Use this prompt with your copilot to adapt the `docs/` folder while preserving the same baseline structure:

```text
Following the same base structure already present in docs/, update all technical context documents according to this project's specifics.

Requirements:
- Keep the same document set and file names in docs/.
- Replace generic content with this project's real stack, architecture patterns, coding conventions, and domain terminology.
- Update backend, frontend, and documentation standards to reflect actual practices used by this team.
- Update docs/api-spec.yml and docs/data-model.md so they match the real endpoints and entities of this project.
- Ensure all references are internally consistent and aligned across docs/.
- Keep everything in English and make guidance implementation-ready for AI agents.
```

### Maintaining Standards

- **Single Source of Truth**: Always update `base-standards.md` first
- **Version Control**: Track changes to standards like code
- **Team Review**: Standards changes should be reviewed like pull requests
- **Documentation**: Keep examples current with actual implementation
